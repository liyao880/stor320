# Instructions

**Exercises:** 1-5 (Pgs. 6-7); 1-2, 5 (Pg. 12); 1-5 (Pgs. 20-21); Open Response

**Submission:** Submit an electronic document on Gradescope. Must be submitted as a PDF file generated in RStudio. All assigned problems are chosen according to the textbook *R for Data Science*. You do not need R code to answer every question. If you answer without using R code, delete the code chunk. If the question requires R code, make sure you display R code. If the question requires a figure, make sure you display a figure. A lot of the questions can be answered in written response, but require R code and/or figures for understanding and explaining.

##  Exercise 5

I don't know if they will look different. Let me check.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth()

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_smooth(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

They do not look different. I am incredibly surprised.

For this exercise, use the **diamonds** dataset in the tidyverse. Use `?diamonds` to get more information about the dataset.

## Step 1: Select 1 numeric variable and 2 categorical variables. Create a graphic using `geom_boxplot()` and `facet_wrap` to illustrate the empirical distributions of the sample.


## Step 2: Choose 2 numeric variables and 2 categorical variables and creatively illustrate the relationship between all the variables.
