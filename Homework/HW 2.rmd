# Instructions

**Exercises:**  1-3 (5.2.4 Exercises); 2-4 (5.3.1 Exercises); 2,4 (5.4.1 Exercises); 1-4 (5.5.2 Exercises)

**Submission:** Submit an HTML file on Sakai. Must be submitted as an HTML file generated in RStudio. All assigned problems are chosen according to the textbook *R for Data Science*. You do not need R code to answer every question. If you answer without using R code, delete the code chunk. If the question requires R code, make sure you display R code. If the question requires a figure, make sure you display a figure. A lot of the questions can be answered in written response, but require R code and/or figures for understanding and explaining.
