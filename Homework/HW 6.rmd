**Exercises:**  4 (20.4.6 Exercises); 1 (21.2.1 Exercises); 1 (21.5.3 Exercises); 1, 2 (23.2.1 Exercises)

**Submission:** Submit an electronic document on Sakai. Must be submitted as an HTML file generated in RStudio. All assigned problems are chosen according to the textbook *R for Data Science*. You do not need R code to answer every question. If you answer without using R code, delete the code chunk. If the question requires R code, make sure you display R code. If the question requires a figure, make sure you display a figure. A lot of the questions can be answered in written response, but require R code and/or figures for understanding and explaining.
